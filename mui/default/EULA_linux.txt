The English version is the official version of this Agreement, and other language versions (if any) of this Agreement are provided for your reference only. Should there be any discrepancy between the English version and version of any other language, the English version shall prevail. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights granted hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Kingsoft Office, and any attempt by you to do so, without such consent, will be void. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise. Except as set forth herein with respect to email notifications and as set forth below, any notices or approvals required or permitted under this Agreement will in writing and delivered by confirmed facsimile transmission, by overnight delivery service, or by certified mail, and in each instance will be deemed given upon receipt. All notices or approvals will be sent to the address set forth in the applicable ordering document or payment notice, or to such other address as may be specified by either party to the other in accordance with this section. The failure by either party to enforce any provision hereof will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. You and we agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Software or this Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to this Agreement, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your licenses. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. By using the Software, you consent to receiving electronic communications from us relating to your account. These communications may involve sending emails to your email address provided during registration, or posting communications on the Software and are part of your relationship with us. You agree that any notice, agreements, disclosure or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing. You should maintain copies of electronic communications by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic copy.

Please review our Privacy Policy ([https://www.wps.com/privacy-policy]) for further detail on our marketing communications. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, it will be executed to the fullest extent possible, whilst the other provisions shall remain in effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior proposals, understandings or communications regarding this subject matter, verbal or written, unless you and Kingsoft Office have executed a separate agreement (For purpose of clarity, the purchase order or ordering documents described below do not constitute separate agreements). Any terms or conditions contained in your purchase order or other ordering document that are inconsistent with the terms and conditions hereof are hereby rejected by Kingsoft Office and will not apply. As noted above, Kingsoft Office may modify or alter this Agreement at any time. In addition, Kingsoft Office may provide additional terms and conditions via the Software or the Official Website and your use of the Software (and/or any acknowledgment of such additional terms and conditions) constitutes your acceptance of any such additional terms and conditions.
